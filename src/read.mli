(** Async helpers for delimited parsing *)

(** [fold_reader ?strip ?skip_lines ?sep ?quote ~init ~f r] produces a value by folding
    over a csv document read from [r]. The reader will be closed on EOF.

    If [strip] is true, leading and trailing whitespace is stripped from each field.
    Default value is false.

    If [skip_lines] > 0, that many lines are skipped at the start of the input.
    Note that this skips lines without doing any CSV parsing of the lines being skipped,
    so newlines within a quoted field are treated identically to newlines outside a
    quoted field. An exception will be raised if the input has fewer than [skip_lines]
    lines.
    Default value is 0.

    [sep] is the character that separates fields within a row.
    Default value is ','

    [quote] defines a character to use for quoting. [ `Using '"' ] implements
    the MS Excel convention: either a field is unquoted, or it has leading and
    trailing quotes and internal escaped characters are represented as
    quote-char char, e.g., {i "\n} to escape a newline. [`No_quoting] means all
    characters are literal. The default is [`Using '"']

(** [pipe_of_chunks] is like [pipe_of_reader] except taking a pipe of input strings
    instead of a reader.

    Note that the fragmentation of the strings in the input pipe is irrelevant: they
    aren't assumed to be separate lines, so each string can contain multiple lines or be a
    fragment of a line, and must contain explicit newline charcters to separate each line.
    If you're using the output of [Reader.lines] here, note that it removes the newlines,
    so you'd need to add them back in, or see [pipe_of_lines].

    [skip_lines] has the same caveat as for [fold_reader]: the lines are skipped before
    CSV parsing starts, so it does not treat newlines within quoted strings specially, and
    it raises an exception if the input doesn't contain at least that many lines. *)

  -> ?on_invalid_row:'a On_invalid_row.t
  -> 'a t
  -> string Pipe.Reader.t
  -> 'a Pipe.Reader.t

(** [pipe_of_lines] is like [pipe_of_chunks], but it assumes that each element of the
    input pipe is a separate line of a csv, inserting newlines in between them. The
    newline insertion is not "smart" in any way, so in particular:

    - input elements with unquoted newlines in them are treated as multiple lines,
    - any existing trailing newlines in the input elements would still have a newline
      inserted after them, resulting in blank lines,
    - input elements that start but don't close a quoted string will lead to weird
      results. *)
