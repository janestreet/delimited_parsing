(** [fold_reader ?strip ?skip_lines ?sep ?quote ~init ~f r] produces a value by folding
    over a csv document read from [r].

    If [strip] is true, leading and trailing whitespace is stripped from each field.
    Default value is false.

    If [skip_lines] > 0, that many lines are skipped at the start of the input.
    Note that this skips lines without doing any CSV parsing of the lines being skipped,
    so newlines within a quoted field are treated identically to newlines outside a
    quoted field.
    Default value is 0.

    [sep] is the character that separates fields within a row.
    Default value is ','

    [quote] defines a character to use for quoting. [ `Using '"' ]
    implements the MS Excel convention: either a field is unquoted, or it has leading and
    trailing quotes and internal escaped characters are represented as quote-char char,
    e.g., {|"a|} for [a].  [ `No_quoting ] means all characters are literal.
    The default is [ `Using '"' ].

(** [fold_reader' ?strip ?skip_lines ?sep ?quote ~init ~f r] works similarly to
    [fold_reader], except for the [f] argument. [fold_reader'] runs [f] on batches
    of [Row.t]s rather than running [f] on each individual row.
